\textbf{1.} Please do not define and use any \lstinline{\newcommand} commands!

\textbf{2.} Try to be consistent --- use environments provided:
\begin{lstlisting}
	\begin{theorem}\label{thm:example}
		A theorem.		
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}[Idea of proof]
		And here is an equation:
		\begin{align*}
			a^2+b^2=c^2.
		\end{align*}
		This concludes the proof.
	\end{proof}	
\end{lstlisting}
The above code produces:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:example}
	A theorem.		
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Idea of proof]
	And here is an equation:
	\begin{align*}
		a^2+b^2=c^2.
	\end{align*}
	This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
Use \lstinline{align} or \lstinline{multline} for displayed equations.

\textbf{3.} Full list of theorem environments defined:
\begin{lstlisting}
	\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}[section]
	\newtheorem{lemma}[proposition]{Lemma}
	\newtheorem{corollary}[proposition]{Corollary}
	\newtheorem{theorem}[proposition]{Theorem}
	\newtheorem{definition}[proposition]{Definition}
	\newtheorem{remark}[proposition]{Remark}
	\newtheorem{example}[proposition]{Example}
	\newtheorem{exercise}[proposition]{Exercise}	
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{4.} Use \lstinline{\note} command to insert notes: \note{this is a note}.

\textbf{5.} Use understandable labels for theorems and equations, and reference them by using \lstinline{\ref}
or \lstinline{\eqref}, see Theorem \ref{thm:example}. Little hints will appear in the PDF file, 
this should help you.

\textbf{6.} Bibliography links can be inserted using the \lstinline{\cite}
command. I am using a single huge BiBTeX file which is here
\url{https://github.com/lenis2000/BiBTeX/blob/master/bib.bib}. 
If something is not in that file, leave a note. 
Example: command 
\begin{lstlisting}
	\cite{AndersonGuionnetZeitouniBook}
\end{lstlisting}
produces citation
\cite{AndersonGuionnetZeitouniBook}.


\textbf{7.} You can email me your \TeX{} files (in which case take
my preamble and put your text into it), or alternatively you can use GitHub's pull requests mechanism
(\url{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/}).
